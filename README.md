# Dungeon Destruction Runner

This repository provides a minimal setup for a small Love2D game written in Lua.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) installed.
2. Run the game from the repository root using:

```bash
love .
```

The game will start on a simple title screen. Press **Enter** to begin playing
and use the arrow keys to move the player square around the screen. Press
**Escape** during the game to return to the title screen.
